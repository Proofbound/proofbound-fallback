## Frequently Asked Questions (25 Questions)

### Category: Why Apple Doesn't Offer Export

**Q: Why doesn't Apple provide a native way to export iMessages?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/why-no-native-export.html
Summary: Apple's strategic decision to not offer iMessage export is rooted in ecosystem lock-in. By making iMessage data difficult to extract, Apple increases switching costs for users considering alternative platforms. This "walled garden" strategy helps retain users within the Apple ecosystem.

**Q: What is Apple's "walled garden" strategy and how does iMessage fit in?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/ecosystem-lock-in.html
Summary: Apple's walled garden refers to tightly controlling the ecosystem to keep users within Apple products. iMessage is a key component - it works seamlessly between Apple devices but doesn't interoperate with other platforms. Lack of export functionality makes it harder to leave the ecosystem.

**Q: What is the "green bubble" problem and why does it matter?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/green-bubble-problem.html
Summary: The "green bubble" refers to the color of SMS messages from Android users in Apple's Messages app (blue bubbles are iMessages). This visual distinction creates social pressure to use iPhones, as group chats with Android users have reduced functionality. It's a psychological lock-in mechanism.

**Q: How does the inability to export messages create switching costs?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/switching-costs.html
Summary: Switching costs are barriers that make changing platforms difficult. For iMessage, these include: loss of message history, inability to search old conversations, broken media links, and loss of context. These costs keep users tied to Apple even when considering alternatives.

### Category: Technical Architecture

**Q: How does iMessage's end-to-end encryption work?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/end-to-end-encryption.html
Summary: iMessage uses end-to-end encryption where messages are encrypted on the sender's device and only decrypted on the recipient's device. Apple cannot read the contents. Each device has unique encryption keys. This is why messages are stored locally on your Mac in an encrypted database.

**Q: What is PQ3 and how does it affect message export?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/what-is-pq3.html
Summary: PQ3 (Post-Quantum Cryptography Level 3) is Apple's quantum-resistant encryption protocol for iMessage, announced in 2024. It doesn't affect message export because TextKeep reads from the local decrypted database after messages have already been received and decrypted on your Mac.

**Q: How does iMessage differ from SMS and why can't I export SMS the same way?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/imessage-vs-sms.html
Summary: iMessage is Apple's proprietary internet-based messaging protocol with encryption. SMS is the standard cellular text messaging protocol. Both are stored in the same database on your Mac (chat.db), so TextKeep can export both types equally.

**Q: What is RCS and how is it different from iMessage?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/imessage-vs-rcs.html
Summary: RCS (Rich Communication Services) is the successor to SMS, offering features like typing indicators, read receipts, and high-quality media. Apple announced RCS support in 2024. iMessage remains Apple's preferred protocol with end-to-end encryption, while RCS provides better cross-platform compatibility.

**Q: How does "Messages in iCloud" work and does it help with export?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/messages-in-icloud.html
Summary: Messages in iCloud syncs your message database across Apple devices and stores a backup in iCloud. However, it doesn't provide export functionality - it's just for sync and backup. TextKeep reads from the local synchronized database on your Mac.

**Q: Where are iMessages stored on my Mac?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/chat-db-database.html
Summary: iMessages are stored in a SQLite database at ~/Library/Messages/chat.db on your Mac. This database contains all message content, metadata, and references to attachments. TextKeep reads this database to export your conversations.

### Category: Using TextKeep

**Q: How does TextKeep export my messages?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/how-textkeep-works.html
Summary: TextKeep accesses your Mac's local message database (chat.db), reads message content and metadata, formats it into Markdown files, and saves them to your chosen location. All processing happens locally - no internet connection required, no data uploaded anywhere.

**Q: Is TextKeep safe to use with my private messages?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/is-textkeep-safe.html
Summary: Yes. TextKeep is open source (auditable code), Apple notarized (verified by Apple), processes everything locally (no network activity), and has no telemetry or tracking. Your messages never leave your Mac.

**Q: What format does TextKeep export messages to?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/what-format-export.html
Summary: TextKeep exports to Markdown (.md) format - a plain text format that's human-readable, widely supported, and portable. Markdown works with any text editor and can be converted to other formats (HTML, PDF, Word) using tools like Pandoc.

**Q: Can TextKeep export photos, videos, and attachments?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/export-attachments.html
Summary: Yes. TextKeep can export all types of attachments (photos, videos, audio, documents) alongside the message transcripts. Attachments are copied to the export folder and referenced in the Markdown files.

**Q: Does TextKeep work with group messages?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/group-messages.html
Summary: Yes. TextKeep fully supports group message export, preserving the participant list, group name, and conversation threading. Both iMessage group chats and SMS group texts are supported.

### Category: Legal & Compliance

**Q: Do I need to preserve iMessages for legal discovery?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/legal-discovery.html
Summary: In legal proceedings, electronic communications including text messages can be subject to discovery requests. Businesses and individuals may have legal obligations to preserve and produce iMessage conversations. TextKeep enables compliance by creating exportable archives.

**Q: What are the compliance requirements for financial services firms?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/financial-compliance.html
Summary: Financial services firms must preserve business communications under regulations like SEC Rule 17a-4, FINRA 4511, and MiFID II. This includes text messages used for business. TextKeep helps firms create compliant archives of iMessage conversations.

**Q: Does GDPR give me the right to export my iMessages?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/gdpr-data-portability.html
Summary: Yes. GDPR Article 20 grants data portability rights - the right to receive personal data in a structured, commonly used format. This applies to iMessages. TextKeep enables exercising this right by exporting messages to portable Markdown format.

### Category: Alternatives & Comparisons

**Q: What other tools can export iMessages besides TextKeep?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/other-export-tools.html
Summary: Alternatives include iMazing (paid, $45-60), Decipher TextMessage (paid, $25), iExplorer (paid, $40), and manual screenshot methods. TextKeep is the only free, open-source option with Markdown export and no telemetry.

**Q: Can I use the Mac Messages app to export conversations?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/mac-print-to-pdf.html
Summary: The Messages app offers "Print to PDF" which captures the visual appearance of conversations, but this creates image-based PDFs with no searchable text, breaks on long conversations, and doesn't export attachments separately. TextKeep provides structured, searchable, portable exports.

**Q: What happens to attachments stored in iCloud?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/icloud-attachments.html
Summary: If you have "Messages in iCloud" enabled, some attachments may be stored in iCloud and not locally on your Mac. TextKeep can only export attachments that are downloaded locally. You may need to open conversations in Messages app to trigger downloads.

**Q: Can I recover deleted iMessages?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/deleted-messages.html
Summary: Once messages are deleted from the Messages app and the chat.db database is updated, they cannot be recovered by TextKeep. However, if you have Time Machine backups or Messages in iCloud enabled, older versions of the database may contain deleted messages.

### Category: Privacy & Security

**Q: What is Advanced Data Protection and should I enable it?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/advanced-data-protection.html
Summary: Advanced Data Protection (ADP) extends end-to-end encryption to iCloud backups, meaning Apple cannot access your iCloud-backed-up data including Messages. It doesn't affect TextKeep's ability to export local messages. It's recommended for maximum privacy.

**Q: Can Apple read my iMessages?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/can-apple-read-messages.html
Summary: Apple cannot read iMessage contents due to end-to-end encryption. However, Apple can access metadata (who you message, when, from what device) and has access to iCloud backups unless Advanced Data Protection is enabled. SMS messages are not encrypted and carrier/Apple can access them.

**Q: Are there security risks with exporting messages?**
URL: https://proofbound.com/textkeep/faq/export-security-risks.html
Summary: Exported message files are unencrypted text files. Risks include: unauthorized access if files are stolen, exposure if stored on cloud services, data breaches if shared insecurely. Best practices: store exports on encrypted drives, use file encryption, restrict permissions, and securely delete when no longer needed.
